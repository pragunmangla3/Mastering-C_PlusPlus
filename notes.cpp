int main(){


// Job of linker - when our file is converted into object, and other object files (iostream and all), it links all of them togather to form a single object file. Which is then executed.

// bedore compiling, the comments are replaced by "", comments never make it to compiler. also C++ pre-processor does not understand C++, it just follows preprocessor directives.
// compiler is the program that does understand C++

// if return value of main is 0, then program terminated successfully, else OS figures out what is wrong.
// int main() -> main doesnt expect anything from operating system
// int main(int argc, char* argv[]) -> here 2 peices of info are needed.
// argc - argument count is the nuber of arguments passed.
// argv - argument vector -> bunch of string

// namespace is used to resolve naming conflict -> naming between our company, standard library, and other collaborating company
// suppose a company defines cout, but its also there in std library.
// :: is the resolution operator -> used to resolve which name we want to use
// using namespace std; -> Use the entire std namespace, might not good a good idea when working in large project
// suppose we want standard namespace in case of cin, cout and endl, we can do
// using std::cin;
// using std::cout;
// using std::endl;

// cin reads from buffer (buffer filled by keyboard) and extract (using extraction operation >> )it to the number - eg - cin>>num;
// cout uses insertion operator (<<)
// cin doesn't read white spaces.

// \n and endl are same, its just that \n does not flush the buffer, endl does. 
//for example - Usually, a temporary file comes into existence when we open any word document and is automatically destroyed when we close our main file. 
//Thus when we save our work, the changes that weâ€™ve made to our document since the last time we saved it are flushed from the buffer to permanent storage on the hard disk.


// use int age {9}, instead of int age = 19; former has some advantages C++ 11
// long int val = pow(10,12) -> is an overflow, will give some -ve abritary value in output. but if long int val {pow(10,12)}; -> will give me error. Better
// global variables are automatically initialized to 0.
// We can have global variable and local variable both with same name, but local variable will be printed inside the function (scope).
// platform and compiler determines the size of the data types
// by default, int are signed
// We can use ` in the numbers, just for our understanding. Like - 7`600`000`000 .
// int val {2.33} -> will truncate the value to give a whole number.
// long double is used for big decimal values. like 2.8444444444444444444444444498798
// short val1 {3000}; short val2 {2000}; short product {val1*val2} -> here compiler will not give overflow error, since compiler is doesnot execute the multiplication. Some arbitary -ve value will be the output.
// sizeof(int) -> gives the size. Can be also used on variables
// sizeof(int) and sizeof(unsigned int) is same, coz the amount of precision you can store remains same.
// LLONG_MAX exist, not LONTGLONG_MAX.
// const int pi {3.14}; is better practice than using #define pi 3.14 -> coz preprocessor doesnt know C++. Its not the modern way. 


// int test_scores[5] {}; -> this will create an array with all values initialised to 0.
// int test_scores[5] {0}; -> same effect as above
// int test_scores[5] {1,2}; -> 0th index will be 1, 1st index will be 2, rest will be 0
// int test_scores[] = {1,2,3} -> an array of size 3 will be created;
// name of the array is the location of the first element of the array
// vectors are dynamic arrays, belong to standard namespace. 
// vector<int> test_scores; is a vector. 
// vector<int> test_scores (5); -> 5 indexes will be automatically initialised to 0. you can further push_back new values also.
// test_score[0] and test_score.at(0) are same. // .at() gives bound check, which is important
// vector<int> test_score (3,-2); cout<<test_score[5]<<endl; -> gives an output (garbage value) ..... cout<<test_score.at(5)<<endl; -> throws an error. out of range
// vector<int> test_score {100,100,100,100}; is same as vector<int> test_score (4,100);
// if you create a 2d vector, count.at(row).at(col) is best.



// num1 = num2 = 100; -> is valid
// modulus operator only works on integers
// count = 10;  result = ++count -> means count = 11 and result = 11; pre-increment
// count = 10;  result = count++ -> means count = 11 and result = 10; post-increment
// type conversion is also called coersion. Promotion is when we convert a lower type to a higher type. Demotion is opposite.
// 2*5.2 -> 2 is promoted to 2.0 (int to double)
// int num {0}; num = 100.2 -> 100.2 is demoted to 100, and 100 will be assigned to num. potential loss of information.
// Type-casting -> static_cast<double>(total)/count -> if total and count are int, but we need double. 
// static_cast<type> -> is more restrictive, and makes sure that it can be coverted to double, unlike (double)total/count (old way), which just converts, no matter what.
// cout<<boolalpha; -> it makes the output of bool variable as true and false, instead of 1 and 0.
// if we compare, 10 and 9.99999999999999999999999 , double will give us answer as true. (since it take approx of the second number)
// not (!) has higher precedence than and (&&), and (&&) has higher precedence than or (||)
// a *= b + c; means a = a* (b+c);


// switch (character){
//     case '1' : cout<<"case 1";
//                break;

//     default : cout<<"default case";
//                 break;
// }




// QUIZ IMPORTANT - 

// if you use a keyword as an identifier, the program will not compile





// BEST PRACTICES

//use int age {9}, instead of int age = 19; former has some advantages
// always initialize a variable, otherwise you will get a warning
// you should name the variable more meaningfully, even if it gets a bit long.
// initialize variable when you are using them.
// dont use #define pi 2.34 -> since the preprocessor doesnt know C++, can lead to difficult errors.
